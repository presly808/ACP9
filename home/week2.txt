       vi - it helps you editing files in linux based system
       use Git Bash only

    java.io.*;

    class File
    absolute and relative paths (differences)

    byte Stream (InputStream, OutputStream)
    char streams (Reader, Writer)

    !!! always close OutputStream and Writer

3. Implement class FileHelper               window analog
       - show all available commands        help
       - changeCurrentLocation              cd
       - find file(dir)                     find
       - show directoryContent              dir
       - show file (content)                type
       - delete file or dir                 del , rd
       - create dir                         mkdir
       - create file                        ? )))
       - show folder structure              tree
       - copy file                          copy
       - compare content of files           fc

       * implement commands redirection
       http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/redirection.mspx?mfr=true

       - deepFind (do search in file name and in file content by keyword)
           * result of search can be written into file

       -* find in file system without recursion
       -* show content of folder
          ex.
           video - 70%
           audio - 10%
           document - 5%
           target - 15%

4. Implement Java Console Commander using class above (FileHelper)
    use design pattern MVC, see example https://github.com/presly808/ACP6/tree/master/src/main/java/ua/artcode/kassa


5*. Do Remote Java Console Commander
 using class Socket and ServerSocket
